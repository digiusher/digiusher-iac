# Scenario 2: Limited / POC Onboarding
#
# Grants DigiUsher access to specific projects only. Use this for:
#   - Proof of concept with a subset of projects
#   - Customers who want to start small before expanding org-wide
#   - Teams that manage only certain projects
#
# To later expand to full org access:
#   1. Remove the target_project_ids line (or set to [])
#   2. Run: terraform apply
